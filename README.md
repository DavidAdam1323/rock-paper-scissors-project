### Development Notes

- The game logic is handled in `script.js` which includes functions to manage player input, computer selection, and result determination.
- Styles are defined in `styles.css` to ensure a visually appealing experience.
- JavaScript dynamically updates the DOM to reflect game state changes and maintain an interactive user interface.
